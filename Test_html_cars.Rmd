## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

Or for a nicer looking table you can use 'knitr::kable' like this:

```{r cars kable summary}
knitr::kable(summary(cars), caption="Summary of the 'cars' dataset")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Inline codes

The `cars` dataset contains `r nrow(cars)` rows and `r ncol(cars)` columns.

## Formatted table
```{r table, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(cars), caption = "The First Few Rows of the Cars Dataset")
```
